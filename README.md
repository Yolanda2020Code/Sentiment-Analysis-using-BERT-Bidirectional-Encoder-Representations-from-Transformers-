# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed to handle a variety of tasks in NLP without changing the network's architecture. This project demonstrates how to use BERT for sentiment analysis.

## Description:
- BERT tokenizer is used to tokenize the input sentences.
- Pre-trained BERT model is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.
- The sample uses binary classification (positive or negative).

## Requirements:
- transformers>=4.0.0
- tensorflow>=2.0

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
2. Use the provided code to fine-tune BERT on your dataset.
3. Save the fine-tuned model for future inference.
4. To deploy, load the model and use it to predict the sentiment of new texts.

**Note**: The provided code uses sample data and is intended for demonstration. A real-world project would involve a comprehensive dataset and more intensive training for best results.
